Translating written images
<p>Translating written images involves converting text within an image to a different language using:<br>
1. Optical Character Recognition(OCR): This involves using tools like Tesseract, Google cloud vision or Adobe Acrobat<br>
to extract the text from the image.<br>
2. Translate the extracted text using a translation API e.g Google Translate API, DeepL or Microsoft Translator.<br>
3. Combine OCR and Translation into a single workflow to translate text from an image.
